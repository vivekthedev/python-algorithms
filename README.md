Collection of algorithms and data structures.

The goal of this repository is to help both students and professionals
brush up on their Computer Science fundamentals. All modules are written
in Python and the tests are evaluated by `pytest`.

**NOTE:** Please use the latest version of Python 3.x to ensure the code works
as expected.
